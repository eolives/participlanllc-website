            <h2>About Participlan</h2>
            <p>Participlan LLC is a community planning, design, and visualization studio that partners with community-based organizations and contributes subject matter and analytic expertise focused on community engagement, housing, neighborhood revitalization, transportation, and urban development to mission-driven consultant teams.</p>
            
            <p>I founded Participlan to center my planning practice in community-driven work and bring high-quality planning, design, and data support to initiatives that prioritize local voices and leadership.</p>

            <h2>Experience & Approach</h2>
            <p>I have worked as strategist, designer, and planner for local communities and the public sector for ten years. Over the course of my career, I've helped government agencies, neighborhoods, and nonprofits chart new directions, define organizational priorities, and build inclusive, accessible communities.</p>
            
            <p>Prior to founding Participlan, I worked at Bennett Midland, a civic sector management consulting firm based in New York City. While there, I led program design, strategic planning, policy research, and operations engagements for non-profits, government agencies, and philanthropy. My past projects have ranged from facilitating the design of a scaling strategy for a community development nonprofit in Rwanda to coaching staff in mayor's offices across the U.S. on developing new solutions to pressing local issues.</p>
            
            <p>I started my career working with community development corporations, public space nonprofits, and qualitative and quantitative researchers to advance community-based planning and engagement efforts, such as Main Street revitalizations and equitable development plans.</p>
